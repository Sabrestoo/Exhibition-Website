"Those who reap the whirlwind..."

by Matthias Wilhelm

The so-called "energy revolution" dominates the political debate of our time. It is driven by the vision of producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable sources. However, this goal is increasingly met with rejection by wind power opponents, who do not want large wind turbines or overhead lines in their own neighbourhood.

The generation of electricity on the seas and oceans of this world promises an answer. The documentary gives a rarely seen glimpse into the fascinating working environment on such facilities. It shows people who erect or operate offshore plants on the high seas on a daily basis. The documentary aims to give courage: because the photos exude a touch of seafaring romance. They show the everyday lives of those whose working lives are far removed from civilization, friends and families.

It is thus a tribute to the technicians and engineers in their professional microcosm, who have become silent protagonists of the success of the energy revolution.
