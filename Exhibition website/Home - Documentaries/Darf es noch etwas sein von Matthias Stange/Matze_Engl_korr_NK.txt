“Carrots, anyone?”

by Matthias Stange

Dinah passes around vegetables, which quickly disappear into the pockets of the six “Foodsavers”. 
The group of people is part of the growing number of members of Foodsharing e.V.
There are currently more than 290,000 members who register online and organize themselves in regional and local groups. Once a year, they meet to reflect on their work and establish a community, even internationally. 
Via the network, they arrange to meet up at markets at closing time to save produce from landing in the bin - legally. 

In the past, Dinah would have gone “dumpster diving”, but there are too many risks these days. Instead, she goes “foodsharing”.
An element of trust between the association, its members and local markets is crucial.
Admission is decided by an online test, for which knowledge of the association’s extensive rules is required.
Unlike other associations such as Tafel e.V., Foodsharing aims to provide access to food irrespective of need. 
Whom the food goes to is left up to the certified “foodsharers”.
They can either use it themselves or redistribute it.

After about an hour, the food has been divided evenly. 
Loaded with bags full of fruit and vegetables, Dinah jumps onto her bike.
“Now off to clean veg and peel carrots,” she calls out and drives into the twilight.
