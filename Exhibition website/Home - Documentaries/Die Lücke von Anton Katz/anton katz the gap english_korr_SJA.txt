The gap

by Anton Katz

In Invalidenstraße 86, on the site of a former checkpoint across from the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, there has been a vacant lot for years. The Fiction Forum of the Cultural and Creative Industries closes it with a temporary adventure site: in addition to a pop-up café and the showroom, where the innovations of the cultural and creative industries are made tangible, one of the best-known paradigms of permaculture emerges: a woodland garden.In my story, I follow Robin, who specializes in permaculture as a biologist and agricultural engineer. At the „we are building future" project site in Nieklitz and now also in Berlin-Mitte, Robin is implementing woodland gardens. A woodland garden is seen as a solution towards a sustainable future, in the sense of distributing space for people and nature, because it produces quality food, creates a balance area and ensures the preservation of the global ecosystem in relation to the current climate debate.
