Sustainable agriculture

by Doris Bulach

According to the Federal Environment Agency (UBA), 51 percent of Germany's land mass is used for agriculture from which about eight percent are cultivated by organic farmers. Who are these individuals and what are their stories? How and where do they distribute their products? The documentary focuses on Markus. He and his family have run the organic farm Florahof near Potsdam since 1991. The family does not use any synthetic fertilizers or pesticides. Their sustainable and eco-friendly production is not only based upon concentration upon local produce but moreover thanks to their short supply chain. Their vegetables and fruits are distributed at their own farm shop, via organic subscription boxes and on farmers markets.The photographs grant insights into Markus’ life which is defined by the seasons and cultivating, harvesting and processing crops according to their respective requirements. They afford an intimate glimpse into the sustainable production cycle through to final sale.
