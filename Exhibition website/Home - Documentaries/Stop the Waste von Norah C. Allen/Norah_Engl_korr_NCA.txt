Stop the Waste

By Norah C. Allen

Garbage – an all-too-familiar daily companion wherever we look. Germany generates 400 million tons annually. A small Berlin alliance confronts this throwaway society.  Founded in 2018, Zero Waste e.V. is a non-profit association which aims to promote waste prevention and reduction nationwide. The members accomplish this in painstaking voluntary work with lively actions, informative workshops and continuous public relations. 

In my reportage I have followed the work of the still-young association. I wanted to know what drives its members, together with allies, to draw attention to the problem of waste and to motivate sustainable changes in all areas. Why, as I wanted to know, do they promote active participation in a garbage-free world through environmental education and action?

During this time, I accompanied clean-up campaigns, where countless bottle caps, cigarette butts or carelessly thrown away garbage from Berlin neighbourhoods were collected. At home with a Zero Waste club member, I documented how you can quickly mix up* home-made cleaner with naturally based detergents such as soda or curd soap and eliminate the need to buy drugstore products in non-recyclable plastic containers. So, each of us can help to reduce garbage. I hope with my report on this topic to stimulate curiosity!
