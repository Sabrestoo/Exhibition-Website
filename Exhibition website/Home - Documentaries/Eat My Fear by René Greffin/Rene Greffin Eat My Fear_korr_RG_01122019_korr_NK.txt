Eat My Fear

by René Greffin

"Eat My Fear": These are four people who make music together. The name of their band is related to an art installation by David Lynch. 
It is supposed to sensitise people to the fear and the intense hormone release of animals at the moment of slaughter — hormones which are then eaten by humans.
Consequently, the band lives a vegan lifestyle, and partly has been for decades.

The musicians deliberately abstain from all animal products. However, this renouncement does not just apply to food but all aspects of life, including their clothing. 
Even their music is defined by veganism. 
Lyrics and self-printed silkscreen T-shirts are an expression of their way of life.

I spent half a year with the band and visited them at their rehearsal room, during silk-screen printing and baking. I went on tour with the band and took concert photos in Prague and Dresden, amongst others.
