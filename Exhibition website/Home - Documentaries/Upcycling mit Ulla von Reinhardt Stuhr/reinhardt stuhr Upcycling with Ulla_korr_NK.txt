Upcycling with Ulla 

by Reinhardt Stuhr

My documentary about Ulla Pfund started in May 2019, when we talked about waste prevention and recycling at the information stand "Trennomania-Projekt" of the Foundation for Nature Conservation in the nature park Schöneberger Südgelände.
Ulla has been an environmental activist for many years. The catalyst was a visit to India in 2003, where the mountains of plastic rubbish – both on land and at sea – prompted her to set up a plastic collection point. During the collection and cleaning of the reusable materials she realised the beauty and power the various materials might also offer for artistic work. 
Ulla is from Gelsenkirchen. She made experiences in communes in the Münsterland and spent two decades working at fringe theatres as a singer, actress and author. 
She moved to West Berlin in her late thirties.
In recent years she has been in great demand as an artist, especially in the upcycling sector. In the past year, I was able to study her attentively at various environmental events about upcycling, during the manufacture of jewellery from bicycle tubes and at children’s events on waste prevention and separation. During all encounters, her affection and commitment were a great pleasure for me. Engaging with stories that are photographically captured leaves you with more than the resulting images. Above all, it leaves you with a connection to the people who stand in front of the camera and want to make a difference.
Ulla wants to continue to move things and she can count on her connections to other environmental organizations and sustainable initiatives. She works at Kunst-Stoffe Berlin, a central body for reusable materials, leads courses in waste prevention and creativity promotion and develops new formats such as a touch parkour and the LandArt sensory trail made of salvage and natural materials (www.ursula-maria-pfund.de).
