Britta Indorf grew up in the countryside. In the spring of 1989, I came to Berlin to study. Since then I have been living in a big city. What fascinates me about photography is the interplay of light; brightness and darkness. My favourite photo subjects are "couples". Why do I take pictures? To capture the magical moments and the light. What do I want to achieve with the pictures? To capture significant moments of life.
