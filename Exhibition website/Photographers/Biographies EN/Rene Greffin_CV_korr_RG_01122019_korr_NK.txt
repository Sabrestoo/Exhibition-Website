René Greffin,
Born in Berlin, he holds a degree in social sciences. For 20 years, he has loved taking concert photos at small venues and doing band photography. 
He regularly publishes his concert photos online at berlinbeat.org. He has various international print publications in magazines, 
books, LPs and CDs, on a poster and a T-shirt.  
Before completing his training at the Photography Centre of the Gilberto-Bosques-Volkshochschule Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg between 2017 and 2019, 
he has had several exhibitions: at Gallery Scherer 8, multilayerladen (both in Berlin) and at Jansbrugkelder (Utrecht).
The motivation for his photography always lies in the productive encounter between people.
