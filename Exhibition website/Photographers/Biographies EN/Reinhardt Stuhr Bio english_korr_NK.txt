Reinhardt Stuhr
Was born in Delmenhorst and grew up in the northern part of Germany, moving to Berlin after working in Frankfurt am Main and Lübeck. 
He was already interested in photography during his studies. For example, he photographically documented the limitations of recycling plastic packaging. In recent times, this has been followed by a photographic examination of environmental issues. This interest is expressed in the portraits of selected activists. His main aim is to depict the people behind the projects and to let the images speak for themselves.
