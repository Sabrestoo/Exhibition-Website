Lotte Kobel
Born and raised in Hamburg, she worked in Israel and Zimbabwe for over two years after leaving school. There she started taking pictures. This was followed by a degree in human medicine in Hamburg and one in scenic writing at the HdK Berlin. She is a resident physician for psychosomatic medicine and currently works as a lecturer and science journalist.
She rejects the notion of the  objectivity of photography. She thinks that is an assertion. She photographs out of curiosity and a passion for collecting. She would like to share this curiosity. Sometimes she takes pictures out of speechlessness.
