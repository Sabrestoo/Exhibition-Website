Petra Dachtler

Spent her childhood near Hannover and studied Slavic languages and European studies in Berlin, Prague and Warsaw. Her passion is travelling and telling about it through her photographs. To her, photography is the best way of sharing her personal impressions of a special atmosphere or moment with others. For professional reasons she lives abroad now and again for a few years, most recently in Tunisia. Her photographs of the unknown parts of this North African country were shown in solo exhibitions in Tunis, 2017, as well as in Berlin, Hannover and Munich (2018/19). The protection of the environment and animals is of personal importance to her. The debate about the future of the tropical garden in Potsdam inspired her for this photo project.
