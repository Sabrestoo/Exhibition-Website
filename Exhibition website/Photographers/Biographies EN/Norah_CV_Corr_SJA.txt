Norah C. Allen
The German-English woman, these days at home in Berlin, discovered analog photography at the age of 12 which became henceforth not only a challenging means of expression of her observations, but her constant companion. During her training as a photographer, she first got to know professional studio photography and then the precarious, dissatisfying aspects of freelance commercial photography. She finally found her passion for archiving photos while studying archive and information science. Today she works as a photo archivist in Berlin. Photography, whether analog or digital, is still a pulsating part of her life. True to the motto: "Photograph your life - if you lose it, it's nice to have a copy", the photographic documentation of the experience is the incentive for you to take pictures.
