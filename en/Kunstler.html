            <div class="about-text">
                <p>The German-English woman, these days at home in Berlin, discovered analog photography at the age of
                    12 which became henceforth not only a challenging means of expression of her observations, but her
                    constant companion. During her training as a photographer, she first got to know professional studio
                    photography and then the precarious, dissatisfying aspects of freelance commercial photography. She
                    finally found her passion for archiving photos while studying archive and information science. Today
                    she works as a photo archivist in Berlin. Photography, whether analog or digital, is still a
                    pulsating part of her life. True to the motto: "Photograph your life - if you lose it, it's nice to
                    have a copy", the photographic documentation of the experience is the incentive for you to take
                    pictures.

                    and Warsaw. Her passion is travelling and telling about it through her photographs. To her,
                    photography is the best way of sharing her personal impressions of a special atmosphere or moment
                    with others. For professional reasons she lives abroad now and again for a few years, most recently
                    in Tunisia. Her photographs of the unknown parts of this North African country were shown in solo
                    exhibitions in Tunis, 2017, as well as in Berlin, Hannover and Munich (2018/19). The protection of
                    the environment and animals is of personal importance to her. The debate about the future of the
                    tropical garden in Potsdam inspired her for this photo project.

                    moments and the light. What do I want to achieve with the pictures? To capture significant moments
                    of life.

                <p>Was born in Delmenhorst and grew up in the northern part of Germany, moving to Berlin after working
                    in Frankfurt am Main and Lübeck.
                    He was already interested in photography during his studies. For example, he photographically
                    documented the limitations of recycling plastic packaging. In recent times, this has been followed
                    by a photographic examination of environmental issues. This interest is expressed in the portraits
                    of selected activists. His main aim is to depict the people behind the projects and to let the
                    images speak for themselves.
