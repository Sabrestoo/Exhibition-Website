                <h5>
                    by Jenny Fuchs</h5>
                <br>
                <p>July 6, 2019. In Hamburg harbour, more than 150 volunteers, family members and friends are awaiting
                    the cargo sailing ship Avontuur of the German shipping company Timbercoast. Its fourth trading
                    voyage brings home fair trade coffee, cocoa, rum, red wine, sea salt and honey from the Caribbean,
                    Canada and Atlantic islands to Germany. The crew consists of both volunteers and experienced
                    seafarers.
                    Â </p>
                <br>
                <p>Today, more than 90 percent of global trade takes place in giant container ships at the expense of
                    the oceans and the global climate. Timbercoast relies on the power of wind and sail. Valuable
                    knowledge from the past of traditional seafaring is being used for modern, eco-friendly commercial
                    shipping. A lot has happened since the pioneers of the Dutch shipping company Fairtransport opened
                    new and sustainable trade routes in 2009. Something has been set in motion on the seas and in
                    people's minds.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In Hamburg, the cargo is unloaded manually like it was 200 years ago. The kegs of rum and sacks of
                    coffee go through many hands and eventually find their way onto cargo bikes and into a nearby
                    warehouse - also emission-free. The documentary shows photographs of a group of idealists and
                    visionaries who spare no effort to support sustainable global transport and to set out for new
                    shores.</p>
