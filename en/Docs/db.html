            <h4>Sustainable agriculture</h4>

            <h5>
                by Doris Bulach</h5>
            <br>
            <p>According to the Federal Environment Agency (UBA), 51 percent of Germany's land mass is used for
                agriculture from which about eight percent are cultivated by organic farmers. Who are these individuals
                and what are their stories? How and where do they distribute their products?
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The documentary focuses on Markus. He and his family have run the organic farm Florahof near Potsdam
                since 1991. The family does not use any synthetic fertilizers or pesticides. Their sustainable and
                eco-friendly production is not only based upon concentration upon local produce but moreover thanks to
                their short supply chain. Their vegetables and fruits are distributed at their own farm shop, via
                organic subscription boxes and on farmers markets.</p>
            <br>

            <p>
                The photographs grant insights into MarkusÕ life which is defined by the seasons and cultivating,
                harvesting and processing crops according to their respective requirements. They afford an intimate
                glimpse into the sustainable production cycle through to final sale.
