                <h4>Stop the Waste</h4>
                <br>
                <h5>by Norah C. Allen
                </h5>
                <br>
                <p>Garbage – an all-too-familiar daily companion wherever we look. Germany generates 400 million tons
                    annually. A small Berlin alliance confronts this throwaway society.  Founded in 2018, Zero Waste
                    e.V. is a non-profit association which aims to promote waste prevention and reduction nationwide.
                    The members accomplish this in painstaking voluntary work with lively actions, informative workshops
                    and continuous public relations.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In my reportage I have followed the work of the still-young association. I wanted to know what
                    drives its members, together with allies, to draw attention to the problem of waste and to motivate
                    sustainable changes in all areas. Why, as I wanted to know, do they promote active participation in
                    a garbage-free world through environmental education and action?</p>
                <br>
                <p>During this time, I accompanied clean-up campaigns, where countless bottle caps, cigarette butts or
                    carelessly thrown away garbage from Berlin neighbourhoods were collected. At home with a Zero Waste
                    club member, I documented how you can quickly mix up* home-made cleaner with naturally based
                    detergents such as soda or curd soap and eliminate the need to buy drugstore products in
                    non-recyclable plastic containers. So, each of us can help to reduce garbage. I hope with my report
                    on this topic to stimulate curiosity!
