                <h5>
                    by Lotte Kobel</h5>
                <br>
                <p>Before and within every picture there is a story. Some stories immediately create a picture. A street
                    leads through a village near Lake Constance. Here is Anniâ€™s house, in front of it a heap of things
                    that looks out of place. It is this picture that brings me to her. But as soon as I spend time with
                    Anni it dissolves: Maybe because we are both collectors; each of us likewise familiar with scarcity
                    and looking for security.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>As a young woman Anni finds love and loses it early. This changes her; her faith, her life in the
                    village, her point of view. She is on her feet from dawn till dusk. She keeps the farm going, the
                    apples in the orchard growing, rents out rooms, takes care of herself and the rabbits, using unsold
                    produce. Besides a shift in her faith something else becomes most important for Anni: Through a
                    pension guest she learns about the living conditions in his home country, Burkina Faso. In 2010 she
                    started collecting and selling donations in kind: Anni takes the proceeds to Burkina Faso to support
                    chosen individuals and projects.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Anni allowed me without hesitation to accompany her in her everyday life. She persuaded herself that
                    my reportage would attract more attention to her commitment. But actually it was strange to her to
                    let herself be photographed.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I had declared that I would follow her like a dog. But when I arrived I was hardly able to keep pace
                    with her as I struggled with operating the cameras, desperately looking for the best possible
                    picture. Every night I planned to abandon the pursuit, yet every morning I was again pulled along by
                    Anni becoming her increasingly exhausted captive. But what ultimately moved me to stay was this
                    moment: her gaze that turns inward and reflects her grief. I am familiar with it and know how
                    precious and delicate it is.
